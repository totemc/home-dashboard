# Home Dashboard 
 
This is a WIP home dashboard to improve quality of life for myself and my family by creating an accessible calendar/dash for tasks, appointments, and reminders.

This project is currently developed to be ran on a raspberry pi on a home network, and more features will be created as the dashboard evolves.

To demo this, simply navigate to the root folder and run with `node server`. API documentation will be added later.

## Technologies Used

Simple MEAN stack application that uses Harpjs as middleware to preprocess Sass and EJS.
