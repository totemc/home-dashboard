# Home Dashboard 
 
This is a WIP home dashboard to improve quality of life for myself and my family by creating an accessible calendar/dash for tasks, appointments, and reminders.

This project is currently developed to be ran on a raspberry pi on a home network, and more features will be created as the dashboard evolves.
